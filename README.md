# ProjektRPS
Project prepared for the subject: Probability calculus and statistics. 

The aim of the project was to write a pseudo-random number generator without the help of external libraries and the system clock, and then to make number generators from distributions:
- Bernoulli
- binomial
- geometric
- Poission
- exponential
- natural

I tested each of these generators using the batch and chi square test.

A detailed report is in the folder: raport
